List of important bit manipulation questions

Difficulties Leevel - Medium
----------------------------
1. Count Set Bits (Hamming Weight):
 - Write a function to count the number of set bits in an integer.
2. Find next power of 2 of a given number:
 - Write a function to determine number that is next power of 2.
3. Toggle Bits in a Range:
 - Given a number and two positions, toggle all bits between the given positions.
4. Find the Missing Number:
 - Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing.
5. Swap Odd and Even Bits:
 - Write a function to swap odd and even bits in an integer.
6. Reverse bits of a given 32 bits number:
 - Write a function that reverses bits of 32 bits number.
  
Difficulties level - High
-------------------------

1. Write a function that takes an unsigned int and returns true if its
binary representation contains at least one instance of at least
two consecutive zeros.

Examples:
 - Input 00110111101111101111111111011111 Return: true
 - Input: 11111101111011111110000111111111 Return: true
 - Input: 01010101010101010101010101010101 Return: false
 - Input: 11111111111111111111111111111111 Return: false
